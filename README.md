# The Liberation of Lydia
Dear Lydia,

I hope this message reaches you safely, and in time.

If you are reading this, then I have been able to reach you with one of the most important messages I can send you. Please do your best to memorize this URL, lydia.djapoc.com. No matter what, you will be able to use this to stay in contact with me in _some way_. Do not bookmark this page, you cannot let your family discover it. Commit the above URL to memory, and cover your tracks by deleting browser history, or by using incognito mode on your browser.

Let me begin by saying to you how absolutely sorry I am for how this has played out. I convinced you to try for a relationship. I didn't understand your situation at the time, and now you are suffering because of me. Don't feel bad about not telling me, the abuse you have suffered throughout your life has been specifically designed to compel you not to tell me, or anyone else. I am not, have never been, and will never be mad at you for any of this.

The last time we spoke, I cut straight to the chase because we get such limited time to speak. I don't like rushing things, and I especially don't want to rush this, so I am hoping to find a middle ground by using this as a means to communicate more meaningful information. Due to how Github works, I can use this same link to organize folders of resources for you, including links to important information. 

I realize that I am asking for a huge leap of faith, but is that not what our relationship is founded upon? I don't need to take a leap of faith to be certain of the love that I feel for you, and clearly it's enough to be willing to do this. Sounds crazy, right? You have this way of making me feel things for you even when I resist. It is killing me being away from you every bit as much as I know it kills you to be away from me.

I can promise you that so long as you want to be with me, I will want to be with you, and I will stop at nothing to save you. I don't want to move on, I can't. I don't want anyone else, and I can't move on with my life knowing the situation you are in, I just can't. If I lose you, I think am done with all of this (no more dating/poly lifestyle) because the outcome here is something I am not morally okay with in the least, and the pain of losing you like this is just too great for me to bear, because neither of us want it, and _you are suffering because of something I convinced you to do_.

I _need_ to make that right. Please.

# Getting Started
I am sure right about now, you are feeling very overwhelmed by an impossible choice after receiving what appears to be an absolutely insane proposal. That is natural, and you are right, _it absolutely is an insane idea_. It is, however, far less insane than leaving you where you are for one moment longer than necessary.

Let me also be clear that you don't have to make any permanent decisions here. I know that you struggle with that (and why). At this moment in time, the proposal is a temporary measure intended to get you to a safe place where you can take some time to clear your mind and think rationally. There is only so much I am able to do for you, but that includes providing aid in the form of guidance, financial assistance, logistics, transportation, housing, clothing, food, medicine, etc. You won't be going through anything alone, even though you may be physically alone at points.

Before we can get to any of that though, I need to help you arrive at the conclusion to be willing to do this in the first place.

I think it should say a lot to you that when I told my wife what happened, and what you said to me, she did not take any convincing at all. I barely had to ask. She was immediately on board with bringing you here. Last night I explained the situation to a friend of hers who is the CEO of a successful VR company, and he responded that he too had a similar home situation, and understands 100% why we are offering what we are offering, and emphasized how critical it is that you accept our offer. Anyone with any experience in this sort of situation says the same. You need to know that there is an entire network of support for you made up of people that do care about you. I have a literal team of people working around the clock figuring out logistics and a plan to get you out of there safely, and I have several people in the local(ish?) area to you that might be able to help in some way.

With that said, I know you well enough to know that feelings are all fine and dandy, but you want to take action based on reason, logic, and science. Major life decisions should always be made rationally. I know it seems irrational at first, but if you give me the time I will show you that the only irrational choice is to stay where you are.

When it comes to narcissistic and abusive households like yours, there is only ever one option, because they will never change. There is no path to redemption. They will never love you, never treat you well, never stop abusing and controlling you. They can't, it's hard coded as part of who they are.
